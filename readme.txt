GREETINGS; WELCOME TO BOTMOD. 

This is a quake 2 modpack that uses the orignal source code. 
In order to run this you will need an offical copy of Quake 2.
All mods done to this project are completely free of use and 
here for the rest of the modding community. By using any
of the software here you are resposible for the concequences
they could cause you, I waive all legal responsibility.

BOTMOD - Deliverables/Mods Inspired by Metroid Games
1) Player one movement hack, is a gross attempt to allow
for client side "rolling" mechanic without touching pmove.c
2) HyperBlaster/Blaster replaced with BFG projectiles, and 
custom projectile logic starts shot of slow and increases
exponentially for more unique gunplay.
3) RocketLauncher recived a new thinking funtion; Rocket_Homing
which flags down non-desirable entities and aggresivly track targets.
4) Heavy Shotgun got a dramatic recoil mod, aswell as enables
player jump boosting... maybe.
5) Grenade Launcher got a cool mechanic, inspired by the character
sprout in brawl stars. Essentially a projectile that will dedonate
until the end of its timer.
6) Custom Commands, press 'z' for placing a beacon, press 'x' to
teleport. It can be alot of things depending on what game we 
compare this to but lets just say its a recall spell.
7) Custom Mod Hud; hacked this together by overriding help
messages in p_hud.c - Gross. 
8) Added a JetPack which was really just a failed attempt to
make a double jump. (enjoy infinite jumping on the house)

I Hope for those who fidn this mod they enjoy it.

CHEERS,

MICAHEL PERRETTE @ NJIT
